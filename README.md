# Ralph

## IMPORTANT NOTE TO CONTRIBUTORS

Effective April 1, 2023, all development and maintenance activities related to the code hosted on Allegro's GitHub shall be discontinued. This means that no further updates or modifications will be made to the codebase. However, the current version of the code available in the repository shall remain the property of the community, and individuals may continue to contribute to and develop Ralph as they see fit.
Allegro intends to undertake further development of Ralph through its internal processes. This development will not be publicly available, and any updates or modifications made by Allegro will not be reflected in the community version of the code. However, Allegro may choose to release new versions of Ralph based on its internal development efforts at a future date.

We wish to express our gratitude to everyone who has contributed to the development of Ralph thus far. Without the community's hard work and dedication, Ralph would not be the powerful tool that it is today. While we will no longer be actively developing Ralph, we hope that the community will continue to use and build upon the codebase for years to come.
